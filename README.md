Big thanks to everyone who came out to the meet up last week.  Appreciate those of y'all who stuck it out to the end to see some code and watch us launch the Nashville Beer Token!  For anyone who missed it, this is a redeemable token for a full mason jar of golden deliciousness.  If you fulfill both the requirements below, you'll get to exchange digital tokens for very real beer.  We encourage buying tokens now to test what the market demand for them looks like as the meet up approaches.  This is also a great reason to practice maneuvering on Ethereum's network while only putting up 5 bucks or so to learn (and get a beer!) 

    A> be present for the next Ethereum lunch meetup on Dec 1st @ The Picnic Tap and

    B> own a token with your name associated to it

Best,

 De'on Summers and Blake Pedersen

The ERC20 Nashville Beer Token is officially Deployed on [0x8a4472ac1b6a5858668345b1408af850129758ea](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8a4472ac1b6a5858668345b1408af850129758ea) Here you can find the key components to interact with the Nashville Beer Token ICO.  IE contract address and ABI code. 

    You can send an ordinary transaction of .015 ether to (re paste address to be safe) and will be rewarded one token. Beer tokens may also be traded the same way as most of other token within the Ethereum ecosystem.  We highly recommend doing some googling and reading if this is a new exercise.  Here's one forum to get the juices flowing. https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1964804.0 .

    For a Decentralized Exchange, we recommend using EtherDelta. At the time of this writing there is a beer token being sold for a 30% discount (0.10 ether) on EtherDelta at the EtherDelta Beer Token Page.

Steps to interact using myetherwallet

    Go to https://www.myetherwallet.com/#contracts
    Contract address is 0x8A4472ac1b6a5858668345B1408Af850129758Ea
    For ABI/JSON - get back to etherscan, scroll down to the section titled ABI and copy/paste that in the ABI box
    Now you are able to interact with the smart contract using a variety of ways through the "select a function" dropdown.

    To buy a token you can run the "claimBeer" function and send .015, or send an ordinary transaction to the contract with 0.15 ether
        Sending any other amount of ether to the contract will throw an error and you will be refunded.  First time senders, check out this MetaMask step by step guide.  This is a Web3.0 extension we fully endorse. 

    To Register a name run "registerName" function with the name you would prefer
        In order to verify that your address actually belongs to you, there is a "registerName" function that you can call to attach your address to a name. (remember everything on the blockchain is public - so you don't necessarily have to use legal name - first letter of your firstname and last three of your last name could suffice)
    To transfer tokens run the "transfer" function and the amount to whichever address you please
